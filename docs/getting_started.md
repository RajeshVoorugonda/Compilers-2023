# Zebra 

## Introduction 
Zebra is a high-level programming language that runs on top of the Python interpreter. It is designed to be easy to read and write, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. This document will provide you with a basic introduction to using the language. 

The language is designed to be similar to Python and C in terms of syntax and structure, which makes it easy for users who are familiar with Python and C to pick up and start using.

## Installation 
Before you can use Zebra, you need to install it. Here's how:

1. Download the latest version of Zebra interpreter from [link](https://github.com/myCSEprojects/Zebra)
2. To open the REPL terminal for Zebra, type the following in terminal
> For *Windows*: ```python3.10.exe .\zebra.py``` <br>
> For *Linux*: ```python3 zebra.py``` <br>
> For *Mac*: ``` python3 zebra.py ``` <br> 
3. Once installed, you should be able to run Zebra programs from the command line.

## Writing Your First Program 
Now that you have Zebra installed, let's write a simple program to get started. Open up your favorite text editor and create a new file called 'hello.zebra'

In *hello.zebra*
``` 
zout("Hello, Zebra Here!")
``` 
Save the file and run it from the command line. 

In *terminal*
```
>> python3 zebra.py hello.zebra
Hello, Zebra Here!
```
> **_Note_**: Make sure that you execute the commands in the Zebra directory

## Language Features 
Zebra is designed to be easy to use and understand. Here are some of its key features.

- Python and C like syntax: if you know Python and C, you would do fine with Zebra.
- Static Typing: variables need to be declared with a type before use.
- Control structures: if/else, loops, and functions.
- Lexical Scoping: the language is lexicaly scoped.

For more specifications, see the full [documentation](language_specifics.md).
